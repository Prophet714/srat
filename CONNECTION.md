# GitHub Connection Attempt

A remote named `origin` pointing to `https://github.com/Prophet714/srat.git` has been configured.

Fetching from the remote currently fails in this environment with the following error:

```
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/Prophet714/srat.git/': CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403
```

The remote configuration is preserved so that fetching will succeed once network access to GitHub is available.
